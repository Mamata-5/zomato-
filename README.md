 Google Play Store Review Trend Analysis AI Agent

## Overview

This project implements an **agentic AI system** to analyze Google Play Store reviews for the **Zomato** app and generate a **rolling 30-day trend analysis** of user issues.

The system ingests reviews, extracts normalized issue topics, aggregates them day-wise, and produces a **CSV trend table** that helps product teams identify **recurring and increasing problems** over time.

---

## Problem Statement

User reviews contain valuable feedback, but:

* Issues are expressed in different ways
* Similar complaints get fragmented
* Manual trend tracking is inefficient

The objective is to **automatically extract, normalize, and track review topics over time**.

---

## Key Features

* ✅ Automated Play Store review ingestion
* ✅ Semantic topic normalization (issue deduplication)
* ✅ Rolling T-30 → T trend analysis
* ✅ Topic frequency aggregation per day
* ✅ Confidence scoring for topics
* ✅ Clean CSV output for analysis

## Topic Extraction Strategy (Hybrid & Robust)

### LLM-Ready Design

The topic extraction module is designed to support **LLM-based semantic extraction**, enabling:

* Meaning-based grouping
* High recall
* Dynamic topic discovery

### Hybrid Fallback Strategy

During development, external LLM APIs (OpenAI / Gemini) were constrained by **quota and model availability**.

To ensure **reliable and reproducible execution**, a **hybrid fallback strategy** was implemented:

* When LLM access is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to a **semantic rule-based extractor**
* The agentic pipeline remains unchanged

This mirrors **real-world production systems**, where graceful degradation is essential.

---

## AI Validation & Quality Assurance

### 1. Manual Review Verification

Sample reviews were manually compared with extracted topics.

**Example**

Review:

> “The delivery partner was rude and food arrived cold.”

Extracted Topics:

* delivery partner rude
* food quality issue

This confirms semantic correctness.

---

### 2. Semantic Consistency

Different phrasings such as:

* “delivery guy behaved badly”
* “rider was rude”

are normalized into a **single topic**, preventing fragmented trends.

---

 3. Temporal Consistency

Daily aggregation was validated to ensure:

 Correct date mapping
 Accurate rolling 30-day window
 No cross-day leakage

---

 Confidence Scoring

Each topic is assigned a **confidence score** based on its relative frequency across the analysis window.

 High frequency → High confidence
 Rare/noisy topics → Lower confidence

This helps prioritize **reliable signals** over isolated complaints.

---

 Sample Output (Trend Table)

Below is a **sample trend report** generated by the system.

Rows → Topics**
Columns → Dates (T-30 to T)**
Values → Frequency of topic occurrence**
